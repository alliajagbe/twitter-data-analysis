## Summary

Randomized Generation of Tweets with Data Analysis and Visualization

## Solution

I generated 100,000 data points randomizing the number of likes, retweets and comments each tweet had. I predefined the tweet categories ranging from sports and politics to health and science among six others. With this, I had sufficient data for analysis. This amount of data formed a representative unit of the live Twitter data as it was unbiased and followed a random distribution.
